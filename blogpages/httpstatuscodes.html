                <h1>HTTP STATUS CODES</h1>
                <p>Http status codes are standard response codes provided by web servers to indicate the result of a client's request. The codes are grouped into five categories that each represent a different type of response. Here are the commonly encountered status codes. </p>

                <h2 class="section-title">Often Encounters:</h2>
                    <div class="syntax-breakdowns">
                        <h2>200</h2>
                        <p>Ok. Successful data retrieval</p>
                        <h2>301/302</h2>
                        <p>Redirects. Used for site migrations or temp links</p>
                        <h2>404</h2>
                        <p>Not found. URL is broken or doesn't exist</p>

                        <p>Internal server error. Server side code failing</p>
                    </div>
                <p>These are the codes that are often encountered. The codes below give some more specific encounter types according to the categories. And for a more in specific in depth view of other possible status code encounters there is a link at the bottom!</p>
